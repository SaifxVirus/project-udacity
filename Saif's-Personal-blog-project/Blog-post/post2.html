                            Udacity's educational offerings explore topics including artificial intelligence, business analytics, cloud computing and programming. Students can enroll in short-term “nanodegree” programs, which function like bootcamps, along with individual courses that teach applicable skills and include real-world projects.
                        </p>

                                A nanodegree program from Udacity is a series of courses, each of which usually ends with a project. Most nanodegree programs comprise three or four courses. Students can also take standalone courses (some for free), but nanodegree participants gain exclusive access to career content and projects.
